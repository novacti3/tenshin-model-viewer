# C++ OpenGL project template
This is a template for my C++ OpenGL projects so I don't have to spend 30 minutes on setting up a project every time I want to start a new one.

## How to use
Click the Use this template button and create a new repository

## Setting up
1) Rename CMake target to the name of the project
2) Configure CMake
3) Rewrite README.md
4) Get to work
